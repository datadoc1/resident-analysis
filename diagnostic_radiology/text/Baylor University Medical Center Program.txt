Additional Information Provided by Program
We offer a multispecialty academic campus providing hands-on clinical training and curriculum beyond clinical radiology, a medium-sized residency training program that is large enough to absorb the impact of night and weekend responsibilities yet small enough to provide one-on-one attention for each resident. Each year we perform over 500,000 exams, ranging from tertiary referral and indigent care to advanced oncology and nationally recognized transplant services. 100% ABR pass rate.
