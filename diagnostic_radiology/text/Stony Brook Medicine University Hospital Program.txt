Additional Information Provided by Program
The department is in a lovely environment on a university suburban campus. Technology and equipment are outstanding with PACS, voice recognition system, electronic teaching files, image research lab and several outpatient imaging centers where residents often rotate. In addition to being a level 1 trauma center and pediatric hospital, our residents also rotate at a VA hospital nearby so our trainees see incredibly diverse and high-level pathology.
