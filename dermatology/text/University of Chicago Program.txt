Additional Information Provided by Program
We offer residents a unique training environment with a very diverse patient population given our location in an underserved area of Chicago and proximity to the Indiana border. We have a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and have established a dedicated residency curriculum that includes lecture-based sessions, book and journal clubs, and community outreach. The program seeks to foster collegiality, scholarship, professionalism, and accountability.
